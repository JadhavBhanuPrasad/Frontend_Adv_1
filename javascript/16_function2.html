<!-- 
    FUNCTION and var are hoisted..we can call it anywhere

    FUNCTION EXPRESSION is not hoisted..we have to call only after declaring function
    FE is stored in let or const , so can't be hoisted
    but if stored in var it can be, but it shouldnt be written in var logically

        const Add = function(a,b) {  //'var Add = function(a,b)' shouldn't be used because 'var' can be redeclared, and function cannot be declared and also function cannot be also overriden in js..there is no polymorphism. 'let' can be used if the FE is called after declaring(as it is not hoisted) ,but logically only const should be used because we want function to be uniform
            console.log(a+b)
        }
