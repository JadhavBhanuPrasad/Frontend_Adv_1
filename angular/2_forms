ngTemplate is for ngIf

two different types
1.template driven Forms
2.reactive forms/model driven forms

interenally depends on 3 main classes(4 actually)

FormControl - each input is considered 
FormGroup - all form controls in this
FormArray - when we want to add in dropdown

TEMPLATE DRIVEN 
most of the code is controlled by html..template meaans html and data binding is done by [(ngmodel)]
formcontrol and formgroup created internally

ngForm -> for forms
ngModel -> text box
ngSubmit is same for both

ngForm and ngModel from FormsModule

#is used for naming #contact

ng g cl model/user -> creates class named 'user' in model folder


control properties 
ng-valid - true if valid
ng-invalid - 
ng-pristine - by default pristine
ng-dirty   - when you type something in it
ng-untouched - by default untouched
ng-touched   - when clicked on it

REACTIVE FORMS / MODEL DRIVEN FORMS -> large projects

FormGroup -> for forms
FormControl -> text box
ngSubmit is same for both

import reactive forms module
formcontorl -> text controls ->2 way data binding occurs by this
ngmodel ngform not used anymore
new FormControl('') is create

to avoid default beaviour  -> novalidate

name elements in angular -> #
