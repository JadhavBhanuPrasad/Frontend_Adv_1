Build phase
Run Time phase

Two ways to compile

Ahead of Time (AOT) - converts html to type script - does it even before html takes it and renders it
JIT - Just In Time -
after angular 9 ,compiler using is AOT
depends on value of aot property(t or f), by default aot is set to true

COMPONENT LIFE CYCLE :

these are all methods
ngOnChanges - if propery of an angular directive changes(*ngIf,*ngFor), ngOnChanges is called // happens every time

ngOninit - when component initilization

ngDoCheck - instead of ngOnChanges when angular fails to recognize the changes

class Appcomponent implements DoCheck {  //all like this only written
    ngDoCheck()
}

ngAfterContentInit - right after angular fnishes initilization of all content in a directive

ngAfterContnentChecked - after the directive content is checked

ngAfterViewInit - after the component's view is instantiated

ngAfterViewChecked - after the comonent's content is checked

ngOnDestroy - when component is destroyed
