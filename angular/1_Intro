developed by google
these are single page application, means one html page will only run
we have to figure out how to load all the pages in single html page
built in dependency injection
client side typescript based structure
disadvantage is that every 6 months new version of angular released by google

first versio -> angular js...js as language..........mvc structure..........
next versions -> angular...typescript as language...component based structure...huge support to bootstrap and others

both are completely different

ng g c sample //to create component

COMPONENT in Angular : a part of the user interface(whole website is breaking into parts)
each component has 4 files...spec.ts for testing....karma and jasmine frameworks used for testing


DATA BINDING :  only data bw ts and html of same component

1 One way : typescript to html
	i. string interpolation -{{}}
	ii. property binding - [] //bind to proerties of html property...[style]
	iii. event binding - ()

2 Two way : both sides..ts to html and html to ts..like taking inputs
ngModel - [()]
FormsModule -> import this for ngModel to work

DIRECTIVE : 
Component directives : is where we define our component, it has three properties, we can make it 5 also, selector, template url, styles, template, style url

Structureal directives : manipulates the dom...like append child..add child..etc...*ngIf, ngSwitch, *ngFor
use ng only here,


Attribute directives : [ngStyle] [ngClass]
we have to give object for [ngStyle] in json format
if we give [style] then give string form


if you directly want to give value " 'Yellow' "
if you directly want to give variable "r1"


we can put services in provider in app module. ts file

httpclient method returns an observable

router-outlet -> its like a place holder for our template, 

path and component in router

route/: to pass parameters

observable in rxjs module

package.json has dependencies

aot and jit are two compilers 
aot is default
angular.json has info about 

compiles even before the browser downloads -> AOT..ahead of time
converting ts to js is called transpilation
